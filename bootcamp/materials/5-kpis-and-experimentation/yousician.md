# YOUSICIAN's KPI and EXPERIMENTATION
I am going to discuss the product Yousician, which offers interactive learning and play-along features, similar to GuitarHero or Rock Band by EA, but to both learn and develop skills on the real instruments. They currently offer content for guitar, ukelele, piano, bass, and vocals. I have been playing guitar for over 20 years, but lessons require scheduling and get costly, so I've mostly been using online resources, YouTube videos, tabs, and books. Where I think Yousician stands out is in using colors for each of the fingers (for guitar players) rather than numbers or letters, which has been traditionally used in books, if fingers are designated at all. This makes a huge difference in playing technique, and is what really stands out from learning without a teacher and with one. 
When I first signed up, they had just released content that teamed up with the band Metallica, using videos teaching about the style by the musicians themselves, and then using the exact fingers and frets that the musicians used to play their own music. This was a big change from the other music that they offer, which is played by an in-house band. The experience they're selling is the ability to play with select bands exactly how those bands play, and getting assessed for your performance. 
What I think Yousician did well was integrate lessons and techniques with songs, and additionally add popular songs for users to play along with. Where I see almost all learning platforms fail is in application of theory. Most instructors providing theory and application of theory are creating content on YouTube and often have paid Patreon access to their own content. While the content they are providing is great, it doesn't have a way for the user to play along and get diagnostics on errors, adjusting speed, or a single place to go to do this. Many players who subscribe to these services are not currently Yousician users. 

## Experiment 1: Escape the Internet Courses - New User Sign-Up Experiment
**Objective** Three of the top YouTube artists providing content for both guitar and bass are currently touring, but they serve a large population of advanced players looking for a single place that is easy and fun to see and practice their content. By teaming with them for their lessons on theory and technique with their practice exercises in Yousician's format would be an enticing reasons to draw in new advanced users. The goal is to see if adding this type of content to the premium package would draw increase the rate of acquiring new users, and the type of content consumed. 

**Null Hypothesis** Adding the new courses does not increase the rate of sign-ups from the existing YoY rates. 

**Alternative Hypothesis** Adding the new courses significantly increases the rate of sign-ups.

**Leading Metric** Number of users who sign up after launching the Escape the Internet course. 

**Lagging Metric** Increase in engagement by existing users with course content.

**Test Cell Allocation**50%/50%

## Experiement 2: Band Mode
**Objective** The game Rock Band was a huge success because people were able to jam with one another, albeit on fake instruments. Creating the option for players to queue up and play along with other users on the same song or setlist would add an amazing experience for the users, as they're getting the experience of playing with another person without having to find a practice space, and allowing musicians to play with one another anywhere in the world. The goal is to determine whether this service would positively impact engagement. 

**Null Hypothesis** There is no significant difference in user engagement with playing solo and playing with others in matched plays. 

**Alternative Hypothesis** There is a significant difference in user engagement with those who can only play solo with the computer and with those who have the option to connect and play with other users. 

**Leading Metrics** An increase in the frequency of users using this feature may predict higher engagement in the long term. Stale users returning to use this feature may also predict stronger engagement from long-term users. 

**Lagging Metrics** The percentage of users who continue to use the platform and continue to engage with the band mode feature over a specific period. An increase in users specifically for this feature increase. 

**Test Cell Allocation** 50%/50%

## Experiment 3: Offering Licensed Music as Add-Ons for additional revenue
**Objective** Most of the content playable on Yousician are versions that are reproduced by in-house artists to sound like the original, but it is not performed by the original artist. One a song-by-song basis, Yousician could get the licensing for users to access the original version for play-along. Since this will incur additional fees to get the licensing. They already have a feature to allow users to vote for new songs to add to their platform. It could be a great way to allow users to get the 'real' version of their favorite music for a nomnial fee.

**Null Hypothesis** Users will not have a preference in original music with a fee to that of re-worked music already available. 

**Alternative Hypothesis** A significant number of users will pay for original content even when the free version is available. 

**Leading Metrics** The number of users paying for original songs brings in revenue and offsets licensing costs.

**Lagging Metrics** Requests for paid original music grows. The number of Regular subscribers pay for single-fee add-on content grows. 

**Test Cell Allocation**33%-33%-33%
33% - Access to new re-worked content only
33% - Access to new re-worked content and option to pay for original
33% - Access to new original pay-for content only

It's important to control for the new content added, and whether it is worth getting separate licensing for the original AND reworked, just the original, or just the reworked.
